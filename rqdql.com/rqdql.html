<h1>Requirements Definition and Query Language (RQDQL), draft</h1>

    <p>IEEE 830 says: "SRS (<i>software requirements specification</i>) should be
        correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, ranked for importance and/or stability,
        verifiable, modifiable, traceable. RQDQL is going to enable the creation 
        of such documents in plain text format. If you're interested to join the group
        developing RQDQL, email to <a href="team@rqdql.com">team@rqdql.com</a>.</p>

<h1>Quick Start</h1>

    <p>Entire scope definition document consists of <i>statements</i>,
    related to actors, entities, use cases, functional requirements, or quality of service
    requirements. Statement starts with entity name, than colon, than statement body
    and a trailing dot. This example has three statements (spaces, new lines, and tabs are ignored):</p>
    
    <p class="code">
        ActorVisitor: an originator of HTTP request.<br/>
        R3.3: ActorUser can view and delete photo-s of himself.<br/>
        ActorUser includes:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;name: unique name of the file;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;email: email address;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;photo-s: binary files, in GIF, PNG or JPEG.
    </p>
    
    <p>Functional requirements explain how actors can communicate with the system,
    and are named like <tt>R3</tt>, <tt>R4.5</tt>, <tt>R1.2.8</tt>, etc.
    The format is "somebody can do something with some objects", consider the
    example:</p>
    
    <p class="code">
        R3.4: ActorUser can upload photo of himself (if email of himself is confirmed).<br/>
    </p>

    <p>Sounds like a plain English text, but let's review the constituents of the
        sentence above:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Constituent</th>
            <th>Semantic</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">R3.4</td>
            <td>The identifier of the functional requirement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">:</td>
            <td>Separator between identifier and body of the statement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">ActorUser</td>
            <td>An actor, who has an ability to use specified functionality</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">can</td>
            <td>Indicator of functional requirement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">upload</td>
            <td><i>Behavior</i> identifier of the photo of the ActorUser,
                i.e. <tt>ActorUser::photo::upload()</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">photo of himself</td>
            <td><i>Property</i> identifier of the actor, i.e. <tt>ActorUser::photo</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">(if email is confirmed)</td>
            <td><i>Modifier</i> for the actor, where <tt>::email</tt> is a property of ActorUser
                and <tt>::confirmed()</tt> is a behavior of his email</td>
        </tr>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>To make the SRS consistent we should explain what means
        <tt>upload of photo of ActorUser</tt>, and <tt>confirmed of email of ActorUser</tt>.
        All other behaviors and properties are clear from the texts above. This is how we can do it
        (text descriptions are absolutely informal):</p>
        
    <p class="code">
        Photo of ActorUser "to upload" means: select any file on a local computer<br/>
        and upload it via HTTP PUT, if there is some error a message shall be<br/>
        visible for the end user.<br/>
        Email of ActorUser "confirmed" means: confirmation email was sent to the<br/>
        user and he clicked the link in this email.
    </p>
    
    <p>As you already mentioned, format is flexible, you can use either full form,
        short form or a redundant form, for example:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th width="500px">Full form</th>
            <th>Possible short/redundant forms</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can view photo-s of himself; ActorUser can delete photo-s of himself.
            </td>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can <b>view and delete</b> photo-s of himself.<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can <b>view, delete</b> photo-s of himself.<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can view, delete <b>photo-s</b>.<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can view<b>,</b> and delete photo-s of himself.<br/>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can upload photo of himself (if email of himself confirmed).
            </td>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can upload photo (if email confirmed).<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can upload photo (if email <b>is</b> confirmed).<br/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Plural forms of any object can be expressed by a suffix:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile</tt>" means "<tt>exactly one ImageFile</tt>, which is "<tt>1</tt>" in UML</li>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile(s)</tt>" means "<tt>one, none or many ImageFiles</tt>": "<tt>0..*</tt>"</li>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile-s</tt>" means "<tt>one ImageFile or many</tt>": "<tt>1..*</tt>"</li>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile-?</tt>" means "<tt>one ImageFile or none</tt>": "<tt>0..1</tt>"</li>
    </ul>
