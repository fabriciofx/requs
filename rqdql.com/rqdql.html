<h1>Requirements Definition and Query Language (RQDQL)</h1>

    <p><tt>
        $Revision$<br/>
        $LastChangedDate$</tt>
    </p>

    <p>IEEE 830 says: "SRS (<i>software requirements specification</i>) should be
        correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, ranked for importance and/or stability,
        verifiable, modifiable, traceable. RQDQL is going to enable the creation 
        of such documents in plain text format. If you're interested to join the group
        developing RQDQL, email to <a href="team@rqdql.com">team@rqdql.com</a>.</p>

<h1>1. Quick Start</h1>

    <p>Entire scope definition document consists of <i>statements</i>,
    related to actors, entities, use cases, functional requirements, or quality of service
    requirements. Statement starts with entity name, than colon, than statement body
    and a trailing dot. This example has three statements (spaces, new lines, and tabs are ignored):</p>
    
    <p class="code">
        ActorVisitor: an originator of HTTP request.<br/>
        R3.3: ActorUser can view and delete photo-s of himself.<br/>
        ActorUser includes:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;name: unique name of the file;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;email: email address;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;photo-s: binary files, in GIF, PNG or JPEG.
    </p>
    
    <p>Functional requirements explain how actors can communicate with the system,
    and are named like <tt>R3</tt>, <tt>R4.5</tt>, <tt>R1.2.8</tt>, etc.
    The format is "somebody can do something with some objects", consider the
    example:</p>
    
    <p class="code">
        R3.4: ActorUser can upload photo of himself (if email of himself is confirmed).<br/>
    </p>

    <p>Sounds like a plain English text, but let's review the constituents of the
        sentence above:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Constituent</th>
            <th>Semantic</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">R3.4</td>
            <td>The identifier of the functional requirement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">:</td>
            <td>Separator between identifier and body of the statement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">ActorUser</td>
            <td>An actor, who has an ability to use specified functionality</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">can</td>
            <td>Indicator of functional requirement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">upload</td>
            <td><i>Behavior</i> identifier of the photo of the ActorUser,
                i.e. <tt>ActorUser::photo::upload()</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">photo of himself</td>
            <td><i>Property</i> identifier of the actor, i.e. <tt>ActorUser::photo</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">(if email is confirmed)</td>
            <td><i>Modifier</i> for the actor, where <tt>::email</tt> is a property of ActorUser
                and <tt>::confirmed()</tt> is a behavior of his email</td>
        </tr>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>To make the SRS consistent we should explain what means
        <tt>upload of photo of ActorUser</tt>, and <tt>confirmed of email of ActorUser</tt>.
        All other behaviors and properties are clear from the texts above. This is how we can do it
        (text descriptions are absolutely informal):</p>
        
    <p class="code">
        Photo of ActorUser "to upload" means: select any file on a local computer<br/>
        and upload it via HTTP PUT, if there is some error a message shall be<br/>
        visible for the end user.<br/>
        Email of ActorUser "confirmed" means: confirmation email was sent to the<br/>
        user and he clicked the link in this email.
    </p>
    
    <p>As you already mentioned, format is flexible, you can use either full form,
        short form or a redundant form, for example:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th width="500px">Full form</th>
            <th>Possible short/redundant forms</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can view photo-s of himself; ActorUser can delete photo-s of himself.
            </td>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can <b>view and delete</b> photo-s of himself.<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can <b>view, delete</b> photo-s of himself.<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can view, delete <b>photo-s</b>.<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can view<b>,</b> and delete photo-s of himself.<br/>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can upload photo of himself (if email of himself confirmed).
            </td>
            <td class="code">
                R3.3: ActorUser can upload photo (if email confirmed).<br/>
                R3.3: ActorUser can upload photo (if email <b>is</b> confirmed).<br/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Plural forms of any object can be expressed by a suffix:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile</tt>" means "<tt>exactly one ImageFile</tt>, which is "<tt>1</tt>" in UML</li>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile(s)</tt>" means "<tt>one, none or many ImageFiles</tt>": "<tt>0..*</tt>"</li>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile-s</tt>" means "<tt>one ImageFile or many</tt>": "<tt>1..*</tt>"</li>
        <li>"<tt>ImageFile-?</tt>" means "<tt>one ImageFile or none</tt>": "<tt>0..1</tt>"</li>
    </ul>
    
<h1>2. Syntax and Semantic</h1>

    <h2>2.1. Object</h2>
    
        <p><i>Object</i> is some data entity, or interface, or actor, or system under development (SUD). More
            formally, object is a <i>class</i> in UML. Objects are specified by CamelCase notation, for example:</p>
            
        <p class="code">
            ActorVisitor: an originator of HTTP request.<br/>
            IfAmazon: XML interface between SUD and ActorAmazon.
        </p>

        <p>Objects may inherit each other, multiple inheritance is allowed, for example
            (<tt>is a</tt> is a <i>statement modifier</i>):</p>
        
        <p class="code">
            ActorUser <b>is a</b>: ActorVisitor.<br/>
        </p>
            
        <p>An object can include other objects, which are <i>parts</i> of it
            (<tt>includes</tt> is a <i>statement modifier</i>). Formally,
            they have <i>aggregation</i> relations with the object. Parts may be named
            with letters only and should not use CamelCase notation.</p>

        <p class="code">
            ActorUser <b>includes</b>: name; email; date of birth.<br/>
            IfAmazon <b>includes</b>:<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;secret key: 32-letter/digit string;<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;account number: unique number of the Amazon account.<br/>
            ActorAdmin <b>includes</b>:<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;access pair: open key; secret key;;<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;mobile phone.
        </p>

        <p>An object can include links to dynamically generated objects, which are <i>associations</i> of it
            (<tt>produces</tt> is a <i>statement modifier</i>). Formally,
            they have <i>association</i> relations with the object. Associations may be named
            with letters only and should not use CamelCase notation.</p>

        <p class="code">
            ActorUser <b>produces</b>: account balance; IP address(s).<br/>
            IfAmazon <b>produces</b>:<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;file-s: list of files stored in S3;<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;instance-s: list of EC2 instances.
        </p>
        
        <p>The main difference between parts and associations is that parts have
            no sense if the object is removed from the SRS. Associations
            still have sense and may stay in SRS, even if the object is removed.</p>

        <p>To reference an object its full name should be used. Any part of
            an object can be referenced by <tt>of</tt> word, e.g.:</p>

        <p class="code">
            ... account balance <b>of</b> ActorUser ...<br/>
            ... file-s <b>of</b> IfAmazon ...<br/>
            ... email-s <b>of</b> ActorUser-s ...<br/>
            ... secret key <b>of</b> access pair <b>of</b> ActorAdmin ...
        </p>

    <h2>2.2. Verb</h2>
    
        <p><i>Verb</i> is a defined behavior of an object. There is a number
            of pre-defined behavior-s of every object, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><tt>manage</tt> &mdash; means nothing, empty behavior;</li>
            <li><tt>list</tt> &mdash; view the full list of objects;</li>
            <li><tt>read</tt> &mdash; read values of parts of object (without sub-parts);</li>
            <li><tt>create</tt> &mdash; create new object;</li>
            <li><tt>update</tt> &mdash; make changes to values of parts (excluding sub-parts);</li>
            <li><tt>delete</tt> &mdash; delete object from persistent storage;</li>
            <li><tt>CRUDL, CRDL, etc.</tt> &mdash; abbreviated verbs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additional behavior can be added to an object with explicit
            declaration:</p>

        <p class="code">
            ActorUser "to approve" (aka "+A") means: reviewing information about ActorUser<br/>
            and accepting or rejecting its access to the SUD.<br/>
            Photo of ActorUser "to convert" means: changing the format of the file.<br/>
        </p>

    <h2>2.3. NULL words</h2>
    
        <p>The following words you can use anywhere, they are ignored:
            <tt>a</tt>,
            <tt>the</tt>,
            <tt>is</tt>,
            <tt>are</tt>,
            <tt>have</tt>.
            </p>

    <h2>2.4. Prohibited words</h2>

        <p>The following words you can not use, they are reserved or prohibited:
            <tt>not</tt>,
            <tt>if</tt>,
            <tt>whether</tt>.
            </p>

    <h2>2.5. Modifier</h2>
    
        <p>Modifier is a collection of <i>predicates</i>, which is attached to a verb or an object
            (there are two predicates, separated by semicolon):</p>

        <p class="code">
            R3.4: ActorUser can upload photo of himself<br/>
                (if email of himself is confirmed;<br/>
                if he is approved).<br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>Predicate starts with a <i>lambda-function</i> followed by object and verb.
            Reserved word <tt>himself</tt> can be used here instead of an object. It
            will mean that you're referencing the object from the main part of the sentence.
            The word <tt>himself</tt> can be replaced by
                <tt>him</tt>,
                <tt>it</tt> or
                <tt>this</tt>.</p>
       
        <p>Available lambda-functions are:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><tt>if</tt> &mdash; if and only if... (other names are:
                <tt>only</tt>,
                <tt>when</tt>);</li>
        </ul>
        
</body>
