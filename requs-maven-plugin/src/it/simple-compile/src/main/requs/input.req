Float is "a number".

Fraction is "a math calculator".

Fraction needs:
  numerator as Float, and
  denominator as Float.
UC1 where User (a user) divides two numbers:
  1. The user creates Fraction (a fraction);
  2. The fraction "calculates" Float (a quotient);
  3. The user "receives results" using the quotient.

UC1/2 when "division by zero":
  1. The user "gets notification";
  2. Fail as "denominator can't be zero".

UC1/PERF must "be 500 millisecond per request".
