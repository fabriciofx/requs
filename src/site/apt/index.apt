Requirements Definition and Query Language (RQDQL)

  IEEE 830-1998 says: "SRS (software requirements specification) should be
  correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, ranked for importance and/or stability,
  verifiable, modifiable, traceable". RQDQL is going to enable the creation
  of such documents in plain text format. If you're interested to join the group
  developing RQDQL, email to team@rqdql.com.
