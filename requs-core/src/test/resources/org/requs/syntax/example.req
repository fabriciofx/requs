:UC1 is a must.

Fraction is "a math calculator".

Fraction needs:
  numerator as Float, and
  denominator as Float.

UC1 where User (a user) divides two numbers:
  1. The user creates Fraction (a fraction);
  2. The fraction calculates Float (a quotient);
  3. The user "receives results" using the quotient.

UC1/2 when "division by zero":
  1. Fail since "denominator can't be zero".
