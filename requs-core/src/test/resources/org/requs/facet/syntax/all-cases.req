:UC5 is a must.
:UC3 is delivered.

"Just a text".

System is "a simple calculator app".

Fraction is """a math calculator""".

Fraction needs:
  numerator as Float, and
  denominator as Float.

UC1 where User (a user) divides two numbers:
  1. The user creates Fraction (a fraction);
  2. The fraction calculates Float (a quotient);
  3. The user "receives results" using the quotient.

UC1/2 when "division by zero":
  1. Fail since """denominator can't be zero""".

User includes: name, address-s, photo-s?.

User is a Visitor.

UC2 where Fraction calculates Float:
  "just divide numerator to denominator".

UC3 where System (a system) archives data:
  1. The system "archives all data";
  2. The user "reads some data" of the file;
  3. The file saves itself in binary form using the encoding and the system.

UC5 where User reads important information of System:
    "this is a multi-line
    informal use case".

UC5/UX must "be amazing for 90% of our users".
