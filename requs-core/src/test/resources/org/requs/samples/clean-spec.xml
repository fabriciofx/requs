    <spec>
        User is a "human being".

        File is a "binary object on disc".

        UC1 where User (a user) saves very complex File (a file):
          1. The user "opens Excel";
          2. The user "clicks SAVE and saves the content" using the file;
          3. The user lists the file;
          4. The user creates the file;
          5. The user validates the file.

        UC2 where User validates File: "we'll define later".

        """This is a comment""".

        Vision: "some **Markdown** document".

        :UC1 is a must.

        UC1/UX must "be cool".
